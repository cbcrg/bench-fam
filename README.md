BENCHFAM
=========

BenchFam creates in an automatic way a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of alignment programs. 

This is done by getting all sequences from PFAM database that belong to families that have more than 10 members with known high quality structures. The stuctures as well as their quality are determined by quering PDB database.
